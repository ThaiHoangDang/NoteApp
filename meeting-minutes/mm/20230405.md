## Agenda
- Figure out a way to implement data synchronization

## Notes
- Our initial plan to implement this feature was to have a "lastSaved" record for the local and remote database and basically replace the entirety of the oldest database with the newest database
- We realize that this could mean that all the old data will be deleted
- This could lead to a problem if a new user makes a single note; all the older notes would get deleted

## Decisions
- Inseo suggested that we could instead allow the users to selectively choose if they would like to update the remote database (thereby updating the remote entry) or fetch the remote data (thereby updating the local entry)
- We observed no problems with this approach and have decided to go with this implementation

## Actions
- Inseo worked on the GUI features needed to implement this additional feature of synchronizing data
- Hoang and Abhay worked on providing Inseo with the necessary methods to make data synchronization possible
