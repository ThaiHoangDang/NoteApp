## Agenda
- Finalize the project requirements for the project review on 2023-02-03

## Notes
- During this meeting, the team revised the google slide presentation, set up the CI/CD pipeline, and added issues to the GitLab repository.

## Decisions
- No decisions were made in this meeting. The team progressed as usual with their assigned tasks.

## Actions
- Since manually adding issues to the GitLab repository was an arduous task, a CSV file was created to automate the process. The CSV file was then used to create issues in the GitLab repository.
